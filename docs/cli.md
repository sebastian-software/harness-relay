# CLI reference

The CLI is a caller-owned interface over the local broker. Add `--json` for
stable machine-readable output; human mode is intended for terminals. Any
command that needs a broker starts the user-owned daemon automatically.

## Starting an invocation

The provider and model are required. Prompt input can be supplied in one of
these ways: a positional argument (especially for `run`), `--text <text>`,
`--prompt-file <path>`, `--prompt-file -` for stdin, or `--input-json <path|->`
for a complete content-part array. `--cwd` defaults to the current directory.

```sh
harness-relay start --provider harness-relay --model fake-echo --via fake \
  --cwd "$PWD" --text "hello" --json
harness-relay run --provider anthropic --model opus --interaction deny \
  "Summarize this workspace"
```

Other start options are `--effort`, `--via`, repeatable `--capability`,
`--timeout-ms`, `--interaction`, `--minimum-assurance`,
`--filesystem`, `--commands`, `--network`, repeatable `--add-dir`,
`--evidence`, `--idempotency-key`, and `--correlation-id`.

`run` writes progress to stderr in human mode, or one event per stdout line in
JSON mode, followed by the complete outcome. It exits zero only for
`succeeded`; SIGINT requests cancellation before returning. The equivalent
programmatic convenience is `createClient().run(request)`.

## Reading progress

```sh
harness-relay events <invocation-id> --follow
harness-relay wait <invocation-id> --until-terminal --json
harness-relay result <invocation-id> --fail-on-error
```

`events` prints one concise category/summary line in human mode. JSON mode
preserves the event envelope and cursors. `wait` keeps each IPC long poll
bounded to 30 seconds even when `--until-terminal` is used. `result` prints
text content in human mode and the full outcome with `--json`.

## Listing

```sh
harness-relay list
harness-relay list --active --correlation build-42 --json
```

The list operation can also filter by `state`, `since`, and `limit` through the
generic `request` command. `--active` is applied by the broker and returns only
non-terminal invocations. Tombstones are included only when explicitly
requested as `includeTombstones: true`.

## Broker and diagnostics

`broker status` never autostarts a daemon. `broker stop` refuses to interrupt
active work unless `--force` is supplied. `broker logs --follow` follows the
bounded rotating log. `--json` is available on broker operations and
`describe`; `--version` and `version` print the package version.

The broker environment is fixed when the daemon starts. Use `broker restart`
after changing shell exports such as `PATH`, proxy settings, or harness
configuration. `broker status --json` reports only the environment variable
names, never their values.

Stable process exit codes are: `0` success, `1` execution/internal failure,
`2` invalid request, `3` broker unavailable, `4` invocation unavailable or not
terminal, `5` route unavailable/ambiguous, and `6` invocation conflict.
