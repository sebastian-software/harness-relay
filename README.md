`harness-relay` is a local, model-first delegation gateway. It lets an
orchestrating agent delegate one bounded invocation to an installed harness,
observe progress, and regain control with a normalized outcome. It is not a
workflow orchestrator, sandbox, source-control manager, or credential store.

## Install

The package requires Node.js 22 or newer and currently supports macOS and
Linux. Windows support is not claimed yet.

```sh
pnpm add --global harness-relay
# or
npx harness-relay routes
```

## First delegation

Discover qualified local routes before starting work:

```sh
harness-relay routes
harness-relay run --provider anthropic --model opus --interaction deny \
  "Summarize the repository changes in this working directory."
```

Use `--cwd` to select an absolute working directory. `deny` rejects native
permission requests, while `unattended` opts into the harness's qualified
non-interactive mode. `orchestrator` turns supported native requests into
`input_required` events for `invocation.respond`; the Codex route currently
supports `deny` and `unattended`, while the Claude route supports all three.

The deterministic fake routes are useful for local tests:

```sh
harness-relay run --provider harness-relay --model fake-echo --via fake \
  --cwd "$PWD" "hello from a fixture"
```

## How it works

The first client autostarts one user-owned broker. The broker supervises the
selected harness process, persists ordered events, and records a terminal
outcome. The default socket is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/harness-relay/broker.sock` when
that variable is set; clients also read the legacy
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/broker.sock`, a migration path that the first release after
0.1.0 removes
([#127](https://github.com/sebastian-software/harness-relay/issues/127)).
Otherwise a private platform-temporary directory is used; state lives in
`~/.local/state/harness-relay`. Override them with `HARNESS_RELAY_RUNTIME_DIR`,
`HARNESS_RELAY_STATE_DIR`, or `HARNESS_RELAY_SOCKET_PATH`.

An outcome separates returned `content`, `artifacts`, observed workspace
`effects`, effect-observation completeness, usage, runtime identity evidence,
policy evidence, and terminal status. Effects are lightweight observations;
they are not isolation, attribution proof, rollback, or a commit.

## Integrating from an agent

For a shell or generic JSON client, use the same stable sequence:

```sh
harness-relay describe --json
harness-relay start --provider harness-relay --model fake-echo --via fake \
  --cwd "$PWD" --text "hello" --json
harness-relay events <invocation-id> --follow --json
harness-relay result <invocation-id> --json
```

Typed TypeScript callers can use `createClient()` from the package entry point.
The detailed contract, state machine, cursors, errors, retention, and privacy
rules are in [`docs/contract.md`](docs/contract.md). CLI flags and examples
are in [`docs/cli.md`](docs/cli.md).

## MCP

Register the stdio server with Claude Code or Codex as described in
[`docs/mcp.md`](docs/mcp.md). The recommended MCP flow is
`describe` → `start` → `events` → `result`.

## Development and contributing

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
```

`pnpm agent:check` runs the standard gate: OxLint and ESLint, the oxfmt format
check, TypeScript validation, the build, and the tests. `pnpm check` adds
coverage and the package dry-run, and is what CI runs. Conventions for agents
and contributors live in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md); architecture and terminology
live in [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) and the [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/) decision
records. Adapter authors start at [`docs/adapters.md`](docs/adapters.md), which
describes the SPI, the manifest fields, the normalization rules, and the tests
a new harness adapter is expected to bring. Work is tracked in GitHub issues;
see the `epic` label for grouped work.

## From the same workshop

`harness-relay` and [dalo](https://github.com/sebastian-software/dalo) are two
halves of one story. Dalo distributes the skills an agent runs: one approved,
versioned set delivered to every agent folder. `harness-relay` handles the other
direction, delegating one bounded invocation to another installed harness and
returning a normalized outcome. Skills in, delegation out.
